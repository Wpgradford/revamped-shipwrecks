# Revamped Shipwrecks

**Revamped Shipwrecks** aims to make every shipwreck encountered unique; by splitting ships into 3 sections, then randomly picking each section from a diverse pool of both custom and familiar options. As a result, each Revamped Shipwreck has interesting new access points and requires different approaches to navigate!

Revamped Shipwrecks have vertical wrecks, which can be upward pointing or downward pointing.

Wreck debris can also generate surrounding shipwrecks, depending on how damaged the wreck is. They can even occasionally generate entire missing pieces disconnected from shorter variants!

Each vanilla shipwreck is still possible to randomly generate, but it's far more likely to encounter an entirely new experience. Revamped Shipwrecks also come in every woodtype used in vanilla.

The Revamped Shipwrecks mod does not modify loot tables, only where chests generate on ships.
